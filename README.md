# Yakopcic Proof of Concept
This project is intended to serve as a proof of concept that Yakopcic memristor model can "learn". Namely, the expectation is that its behaviour (resistance)
in response to depression/potentiation voltage pulses will match that of the memristor described in this research paper:

A short description of each file and its purpose is provided below.
